# How to use this
- Open the .py file with [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Add the directory which contains the files you want to sort to the "source" field
- Add lists that indicate where files should be moved to, and based on what pattern
(For example, a pattern of "*.txt" would only move the text files from the folder)
- Click "sort files"
